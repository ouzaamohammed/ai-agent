# 🤖 AI-Powered Code Assistant & Legacy Refactor Project

## ⚠️ Security Notice:

This tool includes guadrails such as path whitelisting and a 30-seconds excution timeout. However, it does excute local files and **must not** be untrusted or user-submitted code unless further sandboxing (e.g containers, firejailing) is added.

## 🧠 Projec Summary:

This is a two-parts educational project that demonstrates

1. How to build a secure, CLI-based AI assistant using the Gemini API
2. How to use that assistant to review and refactor a poorly written legacy python module (calculator)

The result is a powerful example of AI-assistant software engineering -- blending prompt design, code analysis, and python tooling
